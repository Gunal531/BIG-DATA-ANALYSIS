**DESCRIPTION** |

## Big Data Analysis Using PySpark 
**Objective**
To analyze a large dataset using scalable big data processing tools like PySpark , demonstrating efficient data handling, transformation, and insight extraction.

## Tools & Technologies
PySpark: Distributed computing framework for handling large datasets efficiently.
Dask: Parallel computing library for scaling Python data processing.
Jupyter Notebook or Python Script for implementation.

## Key Steps in Analysis
Data Ingestion

Load structured/unstructured data from sources (CSV, Parquet, JSON, databases).
Handle missing values and data inconsistencies.
Data Processing & Transformation

Use RDDs/DataFrames (PySpark)  DataFrames for distributed computing.
Apply filtering, grouping, and aggregation operations.
Optimize performance using partitioning and caching.
Analysis & Insights Extraction

Perform statistical analysis (mean, median, correlation).
Generate business insights (e.g., trend analysis, anomaly detection).
Visualize data using Matplotlib, Seaborn, or Plotly.

## Performance Optimization

Leverage parallel execution for scalability.
Optimize computations using lazy evaluation.

## Deliverable
Python Script/Notebook implementing the analysis.
Summary of key findings with visualization and performance metrics.
